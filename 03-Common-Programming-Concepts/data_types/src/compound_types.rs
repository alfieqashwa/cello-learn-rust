Compound types can group multiple values into one type.
Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

/*
=== The Tuple Type ===
- Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.
- Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the different values in the tuple donâ€™t have to be the same.

/*
=== The Array Type ===
Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type.
Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.

Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap
or when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements.
